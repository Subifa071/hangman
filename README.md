<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
Hangman is a simple, traditional hangman game with a hint of raw humor. The game 
consists of guessing a word through the discovery of the letters that make it up, whether they 
are vowels or consonants, but if we fail to do so with every mistake, our subject on the screen 
will risk being hanged.
